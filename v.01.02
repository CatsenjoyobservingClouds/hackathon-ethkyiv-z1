1. **Set up the Development Environment**:
   - Clone the repository https://github.com/z1labs/Cypher-Hardhat-examples.
   - Follow the instructions to set up your development environment using 
  Hardhat configured to deploy on the Cypher testnet.

2. **Implement the Vault Contract**:
   - Use libraries and techniques available in the `fhevm-lib` to handle FHE 
  operations.
   - Detail actions for lending and borrowing, ensuring encrypted balances are 
  managed securely.

3. **Score Contract**:
   - Implement placeholder logic to retrieve borrower score, which can be 
  updated with real data-fetching mechanisms.

4. **Compile and Deploy**:
   - Use commands and configurations for deploying to the z1labs testnet.

### Example Code:

Below is a simplified, high-level example of what a lending Vault smart contract 
  might look like using FHE operations:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "./ScoreLibrary.sol"; // Assuming we have an FHE library for 
  encryption/decryption

contract Vault {
    IERC20 public usdtToken;
    address public scoreContractAddress;

    struct FHEBalance {
        bytes encryptedBalance;
    }

    mapping(address => FHEBalance) public lenders;
    mapping(address => FHEBalance) public borrowers;

    constructor(address _usdtTokenAddress, address _scoreContractAddress) {
        usdtToken = IERC20(_usdtTokenAddress);
        scoreContractAddress = _scoreContractAddress;
    }

    function addLiquidity(uint256 amount) external {
        require(usdtToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), 
  "Transfer failed");

        // Encrypt the deposit when adding liquidity
        // Here we assume an encryption library function `encryptAmount` is 
  available
        bytes memory encryptedValue = ScoreLibrary.encryptAmount(amount);
        lenders[msg.sender].encryptedBalance = encryptedValue;
    }

    function borrow(uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 score = Score(scoreContractAddress).getScore(msg.sender);
        require(score > 0.8 * 1e18, "Insufficient credit score");

        // Perform decryption of lender's balances as needed
        // Assume we have an `decryptAmount` available in the library
        uint256 available = 
  ScoreLibrary.decryptAmount(lenders[msg.sender].encryptedBalance);
        require(available >= amount, "Insufficient funds available");

        // Deduct and encrypt new lender balance
        available -= amount;
        lenders[msg.sender].encryptedBalance = 
  ScoreLibrary.encryptAmount(available);

        // Transfer USDT and record encrypted borrower balance
        require(usdtToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "Transfer failed");
        borrowers[msg.sender].encryptedBalance = 
  ScoreLibrary.encryptAmount(amount);
    }
}
