To create a React.js frontend that interacts with the FHEVM-enabled smart 
  contracts on the Cypher testnet, you'll need to set up a few key components:

1. **Web3 Provider**: Connect to the blockchain using a library like ethers.js.
2. **FHEVMJS Library**: To handle encryption and decryption tasks.
3. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Functions to interact with the Vault and 
  Score contracts.

Here's a basic example of how you might set this up:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, create a React app if you haven't already:

```bash
npx create-react-app fhevm-app
cd fhevm-app
```

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install ethers
npm install fhevmjs // Hypothetical package if available, otherwise adjust 
  accordingly
```

### Step 2: Create a Web3 Connection

Create a file called `web3.js` to set up the ethers.js provider and contract 
  instances.

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

let provider;
let vaultContract;
let scoreContract;

const vaultContractAddress = '0x...'; // Replace with your contract address
const scoreContractAddress = '0x...'; // Replace with your contract address

// ABI array for the contracts
const vaultAbi = [
  // Add your Vault contract ABI here
];

const scoreAbi = [
  // Add your Score contract ABI here
];

export const setupProvider = async () => {
  provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', []);
  const signer = provider.getSigner();

  vaultContract = new ethers.Contract(vaultContractAddress, vaultAbi, signer);
  scoreContract = new ethers.Contract(scoreContractAddress, scoreAbi, signer);
};

export const getVaultContract = () => vaultContract;
export const getScoreContract = () => scoreContract;
```

### Step 3: Create React Components for Interaction

Update your `App.js` to include interaction with the smart contracts.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { setupProvider, getVaultContract } from './web3';
import fhevmjs from 'fhevmjs'; // Hypothetical library for FHE handling

function App() {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');
  const [borrowAmount, setBorrowAmount] = useState('');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    setupProvider();
  }, []);

  const handleAddLiquidity = async () => {
    try {
      const vault = getVaultContract();

      // Encrypt the amount
      const encryptedAmount = fhevmjs.encrypt(amount);

      // Call addLiquidity function on the contract
      const tx = await vault.addLiquidity(encryptedAmount);
      await tx.wait();
      setMessage('Liquidity added successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      setMessage('Failed to add liquidity.');
    }
  };

  const handleBorrow = async () => {
    try {
      const vault = getVaultContract();

      // Borrow directly with the amount requested
      const tx = await vault.borrow(borrowAmount);
      await tx.wait();
      setMessage('Borrowed successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      setMessage('Failed to borrow funds.');
    }
  };

  return (
    

      
Vault Interaction


      

        
Add Liquidity

        
{amount}
 setAmount(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter amount to add"
        />
        Add Liquidity
      


      

        
Borrow Funds

        
{borrowAmount}
 setBorrowAmount(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter amount to borrow"
        />
        Borrow
      


      {message && 
{message}

}
    

  );
}

export default App;
```

### Important Considerations

- **FHE Operations**: This example assumes you have FHE operations like 
  `encrypt` available from `fhevmjs`. Modify as per the library's actual use.
- **ABI and Addresses**: Make sure to include actual ABI and contract addresses 
  for both `Vault` and `Score` contracts.
- **Security and Error Handling**: Always include comprehensive error handling 
  and user feedback for production apps.
- **Testnet Configuration**: Make sure your wallet (like MetaMask) is connected 
  to the Cypher testnet when testing.

This code provides a starting point. You'll need to adjust paths and library 
  usage based on your specific setup and the actual functionalities provided by 
  the `fhevmjs` library or its equivalent for handling FHE operations on the 
  Cypher testnet.
